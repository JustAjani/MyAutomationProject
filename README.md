# Web Automation and Scraping Projects

Welcome to my repository of web automation and scraping projects, which includes a diverse range of Python scripts designed to streamline your digital interactions with various online platforms. This suite of tools utilizes popular Python libraries such as Selenium, Playwright, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform automated tasks and data extraction from websites.

## Projects Overview

### Anime and Manga Automation and Scraping (Developed Using Selenium)
- **Anime Web Automator and Scraper:** This tool automatically finds your specified anime, retrieves episode information, and plays them while skipping intros and auto-playing the next episode. It also provides updates on current anime and their schedules. 
- **Manga Web Automator and Scraper:** Similar to the anime tool, this script finds and updates you on manga series, including latest chapters and release schedules.

### Job Finder Tool
- **Job Finder:** Developed using Selenium, this tool scrapes various job portals to fetch and display job listings based on user-defined criteria. It streamlines the job search process, saving time and customizing results.

### Stock Market Scraper
- **Stock Market Analysis Tool:** Utilizing Playwright and Pytest, this script scrapes live stock market data and employs Pandas for data cleaning and Matplotlib for graphing. This allows for better visualization and analysis of stock trends.

## Installation

To use these tools, you will need to install the following Python libraries. Here are the installation commands and links to their official documentation:

## Future Updates

I am continuously working on improving these projects and adding new features. Upcoming updates will include enhancements to the user interfaces, additional automation capabilities, and broader site compatibility. The main objective of these projects is to deepen my understanding of web automation and scraping technologies, and to develop practical, real-world tools that address specific needs.

Thank you for visiting this repository. Feel free to explore the tools and make the most of the automated capabilities provided here!
